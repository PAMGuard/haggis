<h1>Haggis Detector</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Help files for PAMGuard are in html format. You are advised to look at examples for other 
detectors, which are all in sub folders of 'help' before writing your own. </p>
<p>For plugin modules, you'll need to create a Java helpset. This is based around the 
JavaHelp system for which there is plenty of documentation online.</p> 
<p>The PAMGaurd team have been
using <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jhelpdev/">jhelpdev</a> which seems to work well
enough, though it may be  a but out of date. jhelpdev will help you to automatically create the requires
.hs helpset file and required xml files for content and indexes. The files for this are all 
included in the src/help folder. If using jhelpdev, open the file DemoDetectorHelpProject.xml. 
Note that you will probably have to change some of the paths in this file before you can 
use it.<p>

<h2>Help buttons in dialogs</h2>   
<p>Dialogs based on subclasses of PamDialog can easily jump to the correct help page and 
will display a Help button as in the example below. See WorkshopParametersDialog.java for
an example</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Links to external web pages should include the full url, starting with "http", 
e.g. <a href="http://www.pamguard.org/">http://www.pamguard.org/</a></p>
<p>Links to other documents within the main PAMGuard helpset are not currently possible</a></p>
